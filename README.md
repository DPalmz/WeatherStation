# WeatherStation
Code  for self-made weather station and GUI

Project by Dylan Palmer, Lynda Erihim, Brandon Lee, and Felipe Lorez

The purpose of this project is to create a simplified display to show local weather conditions and include some interactibility for the customer.

The Hardware included: 2x moteinos (low powered ardiuno), 1x rasberry pi, 1x TV, 1x custom made acrylic button box, 
and several sensors to detect weather conditions such as a wind speed gauge and a rain gauge.

For the software, the GUI3 inteprets all the processed information from Arduino Functions, converts it into tangible weather conditions and displays that in the TV. Moteino TX and RX, in Communication,
transmit and receive, are what take the raw data from the weather station feeds it to Arduino Functions.
